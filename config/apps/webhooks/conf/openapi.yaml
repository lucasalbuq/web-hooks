    Interactive documentation to use the Webhooks.app tool

    Because it can be sometimes useful to have access to a webhook from anywhere on the internet,
    this simple application can be used for tests and demo in only a couple of seconds.

    The flow is really straightforward:
    - create a webhook and get a new authentication token
    - reference that webhook (https://webhooks.app + auth header) in a tool that uses that alerting medium
    - check the logs received by the webhook
    - remove the webhook and all its related data once you are done

    webhooks.app does not connect any applications, it just means to be used to illustrate the payload that are sent by various application using webhooks.

    Definitely useful for demo ;)
